# Desktop shell

The `desktop/` tree owns the Tauri v2 OpenCodex desktop shell. Its Rust crate
discovers the loopback proxy, lazily retries management authentication, starts
the bundled `ocx` sidecar only when the configured endpoint is unreachable,
and owns the tray, autostart, single-instance, and window lifecycle behavior.

`desktop/ui/` is the startup surface. Once the runtime reports healthy the shell navigates the
webview to the proxy's loopback dashboard (`/#/usage`) rather than bundling or serving `gui/dist`
itself. The page renders what the shell tells it and probes nothing on its own; it asks
`startup_phases` for the state list rather than restating it, takes the current state from
`startup_snapshot` on load because the first states finish in milliseconds, and then follows the
`startup-phase` event. It uses no `alert`, `confirm` or `prompt`: the embedded webview implements
none of the matching WKUIDelegate panel methods on macOS, so a platform dialog is declined without
drawing anything.
`withGlobalTauri` is on so that page can invoke without a bundler. Only the local app origin
carries a capability, so the loopback dashboard reaches no command: `capabilities/default.json`
declares no `remote` entry, and Tauri checks the ACL for any invoke from a non-local origin.

## Startup, quit and the tray

The window is created and shown before anything is registered, resolved, probed or started, and
`desktop/src-tauri/src/startup.rs` runs the whole sequence inside it as named states —
registering, resolving, probing, attaching or starting, waiting, then ready or failed — under one
30-second deadline. Every probe beneath that deadline is bounded by the time left rather than by the
HTTP client's own timeout, so the ceiling is the ceiling, and the budget for finding an existing
runtime is counted from when probing starts rather than from process start — counted from the start,
a slow tray or session-bus registration would spend it and then present as nothing listening, which
starts a second proxy beside the one already there. The failure state carries a retry, the
child's exit code and a copyable diagnostic naming the state, the endpoint, the configuration home
and the runtime's last output; `desktop/src-tauri/src/sidecar.rs` consumes the spawn event stream
into that record instead of discarding it, which is what makes an immediate sidecar exit
distinguishable from a slow start. The page asks for the state list and the run's progress rather
than reconstructing either, because the early states finish faster than a listener can attach.

Registering runs first, before the runtime is touched. A login launch starts hidden, so a tray
installed only after a successful start would leave a failed start with no window and no icon. The
login item is registered in that state too, before the tray, so its Start at Login checkbox reads
the state first run leaves behind. A launch carrying the `--autostart` argument that the login
item passes back is the only one that starts hidden, and only where there is a tray to hide in: a
manual launch shows its window before the sequence begins, a login launch after the tray verdict.
Registering happens once per process, so a retry re-runs only the runtime half and cannot build a
second tray icon with its own refresh loop.

`desktop/src-tauri/src/exit.rs` owns what ends the process. Where there is a usable tray, closing
the window and the platform's quit gesture both hide; only the tray's Quit asks to end, and an
installed update asks for a coordinated restart. Where there is no usable tray, closing the window
is the quit. macOS needs one thing beyond the event loop: Tauri's default menu carries a predefined
Quit wired to Cocoa's `terminate:` and the pinned tao raises no cancellable event for it, so
`desktop/src-tauri/src/menu.rs` rebuilds that menu with an ordinary item on the same accelerator.

Every ending drains first, and so does the tray's Stop, which is not an ending: all of them take the
same phase, so Stop pressed twice, Stop then Quit, and Stop during an update are one execution over
one child rather than several racing. Ownership is re-established at the start of each drain rather
than read off a flag — the pid the endpoint reports has to be the child this app started — because
between the spawn and now the child can have exited and a service can have taken the port back, and
an owner's stop sent to that listener is a stop sent to somebody else's runtime. A listener that
cannot be identified is left alone.

A runtime counts as gone only when the child reports its own exit or the endpoint refuses a
connection; a timeout or an unauthorized reply is not proof. Nothing kills the child; the CLI's stop
restores client configuration and lets in-flight requests finish.

A drain that does not complete within `DRAIN_DEADLINE` is **not** recorded as a drain. It becomes
`DrainFailed`, and an unidentifiable runtime becomes `OwnershipUnknown`. A user's quit still
proceeds from either — refusing to close when the user asked is the worse answer, and a standing
runtime is recoverable with `ocx stop`. A coordinated restart does not: coming back onto a runtime
that was never stopped puts the user on the old version while they believe they upgraded. A runtime
this app did not start is never stopped. A quit that arrives while the sequence is starting one is
held: the coordinator reserves the spawn rather than holding its lock across process creation, and
the quit is deferred until the child is owned and then drains it.

An in-app update downloads and signature-checks the package, confirms who owns the running runtime,
drains it and confirms the child is gone, and only then installs. The order is not cosmetic: the
pinned updater's Windows installer hands off to the installer process and ends this one, so a
restart asked for after `install` is never reached, and the package would be replaced under a
runtime still serving out of those files. A drain that did not complete refuses the install and
leaves the update pending.

The window may navigate to the `tauri://` scheme, to the loopback endpoint the sequence resolved,
and on Windows to `tauri.localhost`, which is where the pinned Tauri serves the app itself because
wry needs an http origin there. That is the one host and no port — not localhost generally, and not
a widening of what the loopback dashboard may reach.

`desktop/src-tauri/src/proxy.rs` is the local management client and has its own network policy,
separate from the updater's download client. It refuses redirects and system proxies, and it will
not send the management token until it has confirmed, from the unauthenticated health body, that the
instance answering is the one the shell bound to: the marker, the pid, and the port it addressed.
The binding carries a generation, so a request authorised under an earlier binding is not authorised
after the shell rebinds.

`desktop/src-tauri/src/tray_availability.rs` asks the session bus whether
`org.kde.StatusNotifierWatcher` reports a host registered; macOS and Windows answer yes without a
probe. Neither construction success nor the watcher's mere existence is the question — the pinned
Linux backend creates an AppIndicator and reports success with no host attached, and a watcher with
no host accepts registrations and draws nothing. Until the probe answers, Linux assumes no tray, so
a window closed in the first moments quits rather than vanishing, and the verdict is published only
once an icon actually exists — a tray that fails to build is a session with no tray, not a claimed
one. Where the answer is no, no tray icon is claimed, the window is shown on launch whatever the
launch origin, and closing it quits through the same drain. The update controls live in the tray
menu, so a session without one checks for updates in the background and has no place to install
them from.

Every tray menu setter dispatches to the main thread and waits for it, and the tray is built on the
main thread while holding the menu mutex, so the handles are copied out from under that mutex before
any setter is called. Holding it across a setter is a cycle, and the symptom would be an app that
stops answering Quit.

## Runtime ownership, from the app's side

`desktop/src-tauri/src/identity.rs` holds this installation's own install id: an opaque value minted
once into the app's config directory and never rewritten, exclusively so two launches racing each
other answer to the same one. It exists because the recorded claim names the owning *installation*,
so the app needs a value of its own to compare against; an id kept only in the shared record would
be whoever wrote it last, and a reinstalled app could not tell its own prior consent from another
installation's. The cost is that a reinstall which keeps the directory keeps its consent and one
that loses it asks again.

`desktop/src-tauri/src/ownership.rs` mirrors the claim, the three answers a read can give and the
comparison, all of which are defined by
[background-service runtime ownership](runtime.md#background-service-runtime-ownership) and not
here. The shell does not read the record: resolving a claim means reading every state path and
failing closed on an unreadable one, on a corrupt anchor and on paths that disagree, and a second
weaker implementation of a question core already answers is the mistake this tree has made before.
The bundled CLI answers it. Until that contract lands, `resolve` returns *unavailable*, which is
not the same as "nobody owns it" — the question has not been put — so the shell attempts no takeover
and records nothing, and the startup state and the diagnostic say which of the two it is.

`desktop/src-tauri/src/first_run.rs` turns Start at Login on once per installation,
before the tray is built so its checkbox reads the resulting state. A menu bar app
that is not running has no menu bar item, so leaving autostart off by default left an
installed app absent after a reboot. The marker in the app config directory is written
before the login item is touched and is never removed, so a user who turns the setting
off keeps it off; writing it afterwards would let a failed enable retry on every launch.
The behaviour is not macOS-only — the autostart plugin implements the Linux autostart
entry and the current-user Windows Run registration too.

The WidgetKit extension in `app/` needs three things that Xcode's app-extension target
would supply on its own, and SwiftPM has no such target: `@main` on
`OpenCodexWidgetBundle`, the `-e _NSExtensionMain` linker entry, and
`-application-extension` — the compiler spelling of `APPLICATION_EXTENSION_API_ONLY` — all
in `app/Package.swift`. Any one missing yields a widget that never appears: without
`@main` the linker drops the bundle and the extension registers with nothing to offer, and
without the entry override ExtensionFoundation traps during bootstrap. Nothing observable
distinguishes these from a working widget, because the bundle still builds, signs and
registers. `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` is also mandatory — `pkd` refuses to register
an unsandboxed plug-in at all — which is why the shell writes its snapshot into the
extension's own container rather than a shared App Group, which ad-hoc signing cannot use.

`desktop/scripts/prepare-sidecar.ts` maps Rust target triples to the standalone
Bun targets and prepares the external binary plus dashboard resources used by
Tauri. Generated files under desktop/src-tauri/binaries/ and
desktop/src-tauri/resources/ remain ignored.

The management API companion presence check in
`src/server/management/companion-routes.ts` accepts both
`OpenCodexMenuBar/` (legacy Swift companion) and `OpenCodexDesktop/` user agents.
This is presence telemetry only; management
authentication remains in the shared API boundary.
The desktop webview uses a Mozilla-compatible `OpenCodexDesktop/` user-agent
marker, which the GUI detects to identify the shell without using IPC.

## Release packaging and updater

The release workflow packages the desktop shell as `OpenCodex-<version>-macos.dmg`,
`OpenCodex-<version>-windows-x64.msi`, `OpenCodex-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage`, and
`OpenCodex-<version>-linux-amd64.deb`. Each artifact is collected with a `.sha256` file;
signed updater artifacts also carry `.sig` files. A release attachment job combines the
standalone and desktop assets, verifies checksums, and writes `latest.json` only when the
updater key secret is configured; it then requires all four platforms to have updater
signatures.
On macOS, in-app updates download `OpenCodex-<version>-macos.app.tar.gz`; the DMG is for
the first installation.

The Tauri updater public key and endpoint are checked in to
`desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Private updater and Apple signing credentials are
provided only as release secrets. Windows certificate signing is not wired yet, so MSI
users may see a SmartScreen warning.

## Widget snapshot

The macOS desktop shell writes the WidgetKit snapshot to
`~/Library/Containers/com.opencodex.desktop.widget/Data/Library/Application Support/OpenCodex/snapshot.json`.
The schema version is `1`; the Rust writer refreshes it every five minutes after an
immediate first write. The WidgetKit appex reads this privacy-safe file and performs no
network access.
