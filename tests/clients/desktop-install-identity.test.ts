/**
 * The desktop app's half of the runtime-ownership claim.
 *
 * The claim lives in the shared service install state and `src/service/state.ts` owns it: the
 * owner values, the field names, the three answers a read can give, and `ownershipGrantedTo`, which
 * is the comparison an installation applies to its own locally stored install id. The shell holds
 * the other half — an id of its own to compare against — and mirrors the rule rather than inventing
 * one, because a weaker version of a question core already answers is how the shell ended up
 * guessing a port it should have been told.
 *
 * Both halves are read here together, so a change on either side breaks this rather than leaving
 * the two to disagree in a place only a takeover would reveal.
